# Learn OpenGL

I'm busy following the tutorial on https://learnopengl.com. Only difference is I'm going to be using Go instead of C++.

## Install

You can download and build directly from the source: 

```sh
$ go get github.com/PetrusJPrinsloo/learnopengl
```

## Configure

To change how the application runs just edit the default.json file in the root of the project.

```json
{
    "width": 1000,
    "height": 1000,
}
```

* `"width": 1000` Width of the window.
* `"height": 1000` Height of the window.
